Utilities in the U.S. and around the world are increasingly moving toward smart grid technology through broader automation, 
integration and remote control capabilities. While this transition has enabled grid operators to meet the exponential growth 
in electricity demand in an economic and reliable manner, it has also introduced inherent cyber vulnerabilities that can undermine 
the security of the grid. The current security landscape of power systems exhibits a juxtaposition of rapidly expanding threat 
surfaces against slowly-evolving deployment of defense measures. The divergence between attack and defense capabilities is in part 
driven by expeditious changes to the grid due to climate change mitigation - movement toward netZero. Since time is limited, we are 
pushing forward with new technologies such as EVs, heatpumps, batteries (all controllable remotely) without really putting safeguards 
in place from the viewpoint of grid cybersecurity. Hence, highly coordinated and sophisticated cyber-physical attacks on the power grid 
are expected and in fact have been growing in number recently. We aim to develop a set of dynamics-aware optimization techniques which will be
utilized to (i) design cyber-physical attacks that maximize the instability of the system (attacker) given
existing protection schemes (protector) and certain attacker capabilities, and (ii) develop mitigation
strategies that can minimize the worst-case damage (defender) in a fast-enough time.
