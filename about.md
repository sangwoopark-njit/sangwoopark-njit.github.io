description: SangWoo Park is an Assistant Professor at New Jersey Institute of Technology
---

I am an Assistant Professor in the
[Department of Mechanical &amp; Industrial Engineering](https://mie.njit.edu/)
at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.

I received a B.S. in [Environmental Engineering](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/environmental-health-and-engineering)
in 2016 from the Johns Hopkins University, and a
Ph.D. in [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) in 2022 from the
University of California, Berkeley; My PhD advisor was
[Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/). My research focuses on designing and analyzing algorithms for 
complex and large scale optimization problems, mainly related to electric power systems, transportation systems,
and healthcare systems.

<b>I am looking for motivated students with a strong Math/CS/Stat/EE/IE background or hands-on experience 
in mathematical modeling and numerical simulations. We have two fully-funded Ph.D. positions at NJIT. 
Highly motivated Masters students are also welcome to participate in our research. 
If you are interested in working with me, please contact me at sangwoo.park@njit.edu. <b>
