title: pay plan and required training
description: Compulsory training requirements for UW-Madison's 2% "pay plan" for 2023-01-01
---

The 2% pay increase ("pay plan") for UW-Madison employees effective
2023-01-01 is available only for employees who have completed required
training, including the [sexual harassment and sexual violence
training](https://compliance.wisc.edu/titleix/employee-training/)
(every three years) and [cybersecurity
training](https://it.wisc.edu/about/division-of-information-technology/enterprise-information-security-services/office-of-cybersecurity/cybersecurity-awareness-training/)
(annually).

Some employees are frustrated and concerned, having
received notice that they would not be receiving the 2% pay increase. There
appears to be considerable variability across departments and
schools/colleges in the extent (or complete absence) of
notifications regarding these requirements, whether an employee has
fulfilled the requirement, and what training components had not been
completed.

Here I will try to collect what information I can about the nature and
history of the training requirement.

### News items

A [2022-12-20 UW-Madison news
item](https://news.wisc.edu/pay-plan-increases-to-take-effect-in-january/)
pointed to the pay increase and its dependence on the required
training: "Employees must also have completed UW–Madison’s sexual
harassment prevention training, completed cybersecurity awareness
training."

Note that this is the second year of this training requirement. A
[similar news item was posted on
2021-12-21](https://news.wisc.edu/pay-plan-increase-in-january-approved/).

### Training and policies

The two main training components are [cybersecurity
training](https://it.wisc.edu/about/division-of-information-technology/enterprise-information-security-services/office-of-cybersecurity/cybersecurity-awareness-training/)
and [sexual harassment training](https://compliance.wisc.edu/titleix/employee-training/).

The [salary adjustment
policy](https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-5023) mentions the
training requirement. (See Section IV D.)

See also the [sexual harassment
policy](https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-146), [section
VIII](https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-146#Pol146_VIII) 2.

This appears to be a system-level policy, though I can't find any
mention of the connection between pay increases and the required
training in system-level policy documents.

In the [system-level policy on cybersecurity
training](https://www.wisconsin.edu/uw-policies/uw-system-administrative-policies/information-security-awareness/),
see [Section
6](https://www.wisconsin.edu/uw-policies/uw-system-administrative-policies/information-security-awareness/#6.PolicyStatement)
A: "Employees shall be assigned security awareness training on an annual basis. Security awareness training must be completed within the timeframe prescribed."

In the [system-level sexual harassment
 policy](https://www.wisconsin.edu/regents/policies/sexual-violence-and-sexual-harassment/),
 see Section IV.

### Other campuses

It seems clear that this is a system-wide policy. I found mention of
the dependence of pay increases on these training courses at the
following campuses:

- [Green Bay](https://www.uwgb.edu/human-resources/learning-development/required-training/)

- [La Crosse](https://kb.uwlax.edu/103700)

- [Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/hr/compliance-training/)

- [Oshkosh](https://uwosh.edu/hr/policies-procedures/pay-plan/)

- [Stevens Point](https://www3.uwsp.edu/hr/Pages/Training%20and%20Development/Merit-and-Pay-Plan.aspx)


### Looking up course completion

It can be difficult to determine whether training obligations have
been met.

For the sexual harassment and the cybersecurity training, it seems
that you go to the Office of Human Resources site "[My registrations and learning transcript](https://www.talent.wisc.edu/catalog/MyRegistrationsandLearningTranscript/tabid/91/Default.aspx)".
Log in with a NetID and click "transcript". I think you're looking for
"Cybersecurity Awareness Training 2022" and "Preventing Sexual
Harassment and Sexual Violence at UW–Madison 2018 - 2021" or similar.

In the School of Medicine and Public Health, we also need to take
HIPAA training (look up course completion information at the
[VCRGE training lookup site](https://apps.research.wisc.edu/TILT/))
and [Professional Conduct
training](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/327482), available in
[Canvas](https://canvas.wisc.edu).
