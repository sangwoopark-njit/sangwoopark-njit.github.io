## Summary

Here's a stab at a summary of the above, though things are more
complicated than can be captured here.

- whether prior approval is required
- quota on number of days per month ("&ndash;" if no
  quota; 0 if any amount requires approval)
- whether policy only covers paid activities or applies more generally
